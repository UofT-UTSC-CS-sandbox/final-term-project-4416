Enough user stories, but I guess you could present it better by categorizing it in the following topics.

* Note Creation & Management
* User Profile Management
* Advanced Note Features
* Collaboration & Sharing
* Flashcards
* Customization & Appearance
* Mind Maps
* Efficiency & Organization


user experience /interface ⇒ 4 

good job on using figma

Software setup ⇒  1 

Could explain more about why react/node-js and why not other options like Angular/fastapi-python
Just a suggestion to you guys, not important if you apply it to your project or not: It’s a good idea to lean toward typescript rather than vanilla java script
The architecture could use a diagram explaining the technical components
Minor typos

readme.md ⇒ 2

Good job on using ToC but it’s not responsive.
You don’t actually need to explain the node js installation process or similar applications. These have their own thorough documentation explaining the installation process and you can just point to the documentation. You only are responsible to explain your application-specific commands.
