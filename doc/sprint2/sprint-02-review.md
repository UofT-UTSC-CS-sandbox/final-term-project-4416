 > _Note: _ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 > _Suggestion: _ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect
 * When: July 5, 2024 / Wednesday
 * Where: Online / Discord meeting

## Process - Reflection
#### Short introduction:
In this literation, we delete the old version of markdown editor and completer create a new one. Appart from this, we make it adjust to the old orignal function...

#### Decisions that turned out well
##### Complete a new Markdown Editor：
###### Why it was successful:
>1. The old version of the Markdown editor was built using Node 16, which was incompatible with a lot of our local code and could potentially cause issues with future updates. By creating a new Markdown editor, we ensured compatibility with our current tech stack, enhanced performance, and reduced the likelihood of encountering integration problems in the future. Additionally, the new editor supports more advanced features, such as mathematical symbols and expressions, improving the overall functionality and user experience.
###### Artifacts:
>1. Source code of the new Markdown editor: [CreatNote.js](https://github.com/UofT-UTSC-CS-sandbox/final-term-project-4416/blob/main/notewiz/client/src/components/CreateNote.js)
##### Integrating ChatGPT API and Automating Note Generation：
###### Why it was successful:
>1. Increased Efficiency: By integrating the ChatGPT API and automating note generation, we significantly improved the efficiency of note creation for users. Users can input minimal information or questions, and the system automatically generates detailed notes, saving a substantial amount of time and effort.
>2. Enhanced User Experience: The automated note generation feature makes it easier for users to obtain the information they need, thereby enhancing the overall user experience. This feature is especially attractive to users who need to quickly organize and record information.
>3. Improved Note Quality: The notes generated by the ChatGPT API are well-structured and fluent, helping users create high-quality notes. This not only increases the professionalism of the notes but also reduces the potential errors users might encounter while organizing and writing notes.
>4. Technological Innovation: By integrating cutting-edge AI technology, we demonstrated the team's capability and foresight in technological innovation, enhancing the product's competitiveness and market appeal.
###### Artifacts:
>1. Using API to accelerate our product development[API](1.png)

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
##### Neglecting Code Documentation and Comments：
###### Why it was not successful:
>1. Neglecting code documentation and comments leads to maintenance difficulties, especially for new team members or developers revisiting the code after some time. Code that lacks documentation and comments is hard to understand and maintain, and knowledge and experience may be lost if the original developers leave, affecting the project's continuity and stability. Moreover, debugging and fixing issues become more challenging and time-consuming, impacting development efficiency and project timelines. Collaboration among team members is also hindered, as poor code readability can lead to miscommunication and increased chances of errors.
###### Artifacts:
>1. None
##### Failing to Enhance Password Security for Login and Registration：
###### Why it was unsuccessful:
>1. Failing to enhance password security for login and registration significantly increases the risk of user accounts being hacked and information being leaked, creating serious security vulnerabilities. Insufficient security measures can erode user trust in the product, as they may worry about the safety of their personal information and data, leading to reduced usage or complete abandonment of the product. Additionally, failing to improve password security may result in non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations, exposing the company to legal actions and fines. In the event of a security breach, negative publicity from the media and users can quickly spread, severely damaging the company's brand and market reputation.
###### Artifacts:
>1. None

#### Planned changes

##### Enhancing Password Security with Proper Hashing Techniques

###### Reason for Change:
>1. The previous decision to use weak hashing algorithms, such as SHA-1, for password storage has resulted in significant security vulnerabilities. By implementing stronger hashing techniques, such as bcrypt, we aim to enhance the security of user passwords, protecting them from brute force and rainbow table attacks. This change will help us comply with security standards and build greater trust with our users.

###### Benefits:
>1. Increased security for user passwords, reducing the risk of breaches.
>2. Compliance with modern security standards and regulations.
>3. Enhanced user trust and confidence in the platform's security measures.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

##### Improved note organization and categorization:
>1. Enhance the note organization system by introducing tags, folders, and color-coding options. This will help users to efficiently categorize and retrieve their notes, improving overall usability and productivity.

##### Real-time collaboration and sharing:
>1. Implement real-time collaboration features that allow multiple users to edit notes simultaneously and share them easily. This will facilitate teamwork and knowledge sharing, making the application more versatile and user-friendly.
