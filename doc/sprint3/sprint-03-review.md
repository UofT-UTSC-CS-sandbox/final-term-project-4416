## Iteration 3 - Review & Retrospect

* When: 2024-07-19
* Where: Online via Zoom

## Process - Reflection

In this iteration, we focused on implementing new features and enhancing existing functionalities. We integrated the mind-map interface, improved the public note searching feature, automated note conversion to flashcards, and added a note-sharing service. These enhancements aimed to improve the overall user experience and functionality of the Notewiz application.

### Decisions that turned out well

1. **Improved Task Assignment**: We implemented clearer task assignments in this iteration, which significantly increased efficiency.
2. **Daily Stand-up Meetings**: Daily stand-up meetings helped us quickly identify and resolve issues, ensuring smooth project progress.
3. **Code Reviews**: Introducing code reviews allowed us to identify and fix many potential issues, improving code quality.

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. **Time Management**: Despite better task assignments, time management was still an issue, with some tasks exceeding expected durations.
2. **Communication Tool Selection**: There were disagreements over communication tools, leading to inefficient information exchange.
3. **Change Management**: Frequent requirement changes made it difficult to adapt, highlighting the need for better change management processes.

### Planned changes

1. **Improved Time Management**: Plan to use a more detailed scheduling system to ensure tasks are completed within controllable timeframes.
2. **Unified Communication Tool**: All team members will use a single communication tool to ensure timely and accurate information exchange.
3. **Change Management**: Introduce a change request process to ensure all requirement changes are evaluated and approved.
